# CREDIT-RISK-PREDICTION-THROUGH-ENSEMBLE-TECHNIQUES-AND-MODEL-AGNOSTIC-METHODS
This study delves into artificial intelligence's (AI) transparency in credit risk prediction, explicitly focusing on four ensemble techniques and two model-agnostic methods.

This investigation employed ensemble learning models, including random forest, bagging classifier with decision trees, AdaBoost, and XGBoost algorithms, to predict credit risk. These models were extensively compared regarding accuracy, precision, recall, AUC score and confusion matrices. Subsequently, the optimal model was obtained by hyperparameter tuning. The optimal random forest model exhibited outstanding performance, boasting an accuracy of 97%, precision of 98%, recall of 93%, and an AUC of 96%. The scores matched the best-performing random forest model from the initial 25 experiments.
Despite the similar scores, a nuanced analysis of the confusion matrices revealed distinct strengths for each model. The tuned model minimised false negatives, indicating its proficiency in accurately identifying loan defaults, while the best initial experiment demonstrated a notable ability to minimise false positives.
The preference for the tuned random forest model is grounded in its superior capability to precisely identify loan default cases, ultimately reducing potential losses for the company. This robust performance solidified the selection of the tuned random forest as the preferred prediction model for credit risk.
Furthermore, the model's explainability was explored through SHAP and LIME algorithms, revealing loan fees, loan cost, loan duration and customer lending information such as borrow rate, employment status and credit score are features for identifying high-risk loans. These insights provide valuable information for lenders to mitigate risks, establish suitable loan terms, and ensure long-term viability.
Future studies will incorporate advanced strategies such as stacking, a hierarchical model integration framework and explore complex neural networks. Additionally, the need to incorporate macroeconomic features in the dataset is recognized for enhanced predictive accuracy and a more comprehensive understanding of credit risk dynamics. This highlights the importance of continuous research efforts to refine and expand predictive models in credit risk assessment.
